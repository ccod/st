st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.
This is my fork of the project. customizations are on ccod_patches branch

# Requirements
* In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
* installation of the Fira Code font.

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).<br/>

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):
